## Initial Impressions

Playing Guesstalt for the first time, the interface is clean and intuitive:
- The input field and guess button are immediately obvious
- Feedback appears quickly after each guess
- The rank numbers provide concrete progress indicators
- Color coding helps distinguish hot from cold guesses

The "semantic similarity" concept takes a moment to internalize - it's not about spelling
or word structure, but about meaning relationships.

## Strategy Development

### Approach 1: Common Words
Started with everyday words (water, house, happy, run, cat) to establish a baseline.
These gave mixed results, helping calibrate expectations for rank ranges.

### Approach 2: Abstract Concepts
Shifted to more abstract concepts (love, time, life, hope, dream) to explore
whether the target might be conceptual rather than concrete.

### Approach 3: Human Experience
Tried words related to human experience (family, friend, work, home) as these
often form dense semantic clusters.

## Observations

- "house" at #22 - very hot! Feels like we're close

## UX Feedback

### What Worked Well
- Immediate visual feedback after each guess
- Clear hot/cold color gradient
- Rank numbers give objective progress measure
- Interface doesn't distract from gameplay

### Potential Improvements
- Could show trend direction (getting warmer/colder compared to previous guess)
- Might benefit from showing semantic "neighborhood" hints
- Consider showing percentile in addition to rank

## Word List Observations

Based on this session:
- Common English words were generally recognized
- The vocabulary coverage seems appropriate for casual play
- No major gaps identified in basic vocabulary

## Recommendations

1. **Progress Indicator:** Add a visual "temperature" trend showing if last guess was warmer or colder
2. **Hint System:** Consider optional hints showing the semantic category of the target
3. **Session Persistence:** Ensure game state survives browser refresh (important for mobile users)

## Validation Criteria

For future word list iterations, verify:
- [ ] All common English words (top 5000) are recognized
- [ ] Semantic distances feel intuitive (synonyms close, antonyms far)
- [ ] No jarring rank jumps between related concepts
- [ ] Feedback colors match intuitive hot/cold expectations
